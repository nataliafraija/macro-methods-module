# Macro Methods Module

This repository contains the course materials for my Masters level module on methods in macroecology and macroevolution. It is mainly focussed on phylogenetic comparative methods in R.

The link to the HTML version of the course book is [here](https://rawgit.com/nhcooper123/macro-methods-module/master/MacroModule/_book/index.html).
